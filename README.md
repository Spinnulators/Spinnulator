# Spinnulator
Spinnulator is a simulator using cycling on a spinning bike. The positions and movements of the players body are tracked by a Microsoft Kinect and translated into a virtual environment. The player moves forward by cycling and their momentum will be retained just as in the real world, the player turns by tilting their whole body.
