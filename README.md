# Spinnulator
Spinnulator is simulator using cycling on a spinning bike. The positions and movements of the players body are tracked by a Microsoft Kinect and translated into a virtual environment. The player can move forward by cycling where their momentum will be retained just as in the real world, and the player can turn by tilting their whole body.
