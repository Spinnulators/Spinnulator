# Spinnulator
Spinnulator is simulator using cycling on a spinning bike. The positions and movements of the players body are tracked by a Microsoft Kinect and translated into a virtual environment. The player can move forward by cycling where their momentum is retained just like in the real world, and the player can turn by tilting their whole body.
